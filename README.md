# PlantCareReminder
I have created a Plant Care Reminder Application where users can set water reminders or fertilizer for different plants 
I have used JSP to build this project..
I havent added the login and signup options to remove complexity but will add them soon, i havent properly created the reminder part because i was creating this as a part of my academic project and i have to show them the running part, as concerend with plant reminders there are some set timming in which we can water and fertilize them .
